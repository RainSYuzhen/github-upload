We are seeking new teammate to join us at Lifespans (www.lifespans.net), a medical device startup that creates innovative orthopaedic implant technologies for elderly patients.\n\nFounded by surgeons and engineers from HKU Queen Mary Hospital and MIT, Lifespans is a medical technology startup company entering the rapid growth stage. Our mission is to radically improve the way that orthopaedic medical devices are designed for elderly patients with osteoporosis \u2014 a disease that affects over 250 million people worldwide. We design and manufacture orthopaedic implants and surgical instruments that are used to repair fractured bones. Sales of our first implant products will launch this year.\n\nOur team also invented a software technology for the simulation of bone and implants, named Alfonso: the Implant Simulator, that was inspired by our experience during the R&D process and the great need for efficient testing tools in the orthopaedics industry. We use Alfonso to run virtual tests of medical device designs to predict their performance after being implanted in the body. Since our launch of Alfonso testing services last year, we have rapidly grown our customer base and includes the top manufacturers in the orthopaedics industry.\n\n- - -\n\nCompany:\u00a0 Lifespans, Ltd. \u2013 a privately-financed medical device startup.\u00a0Lifespans is a spinoff from The University of Hong Kong (HKU) medical school.
