It was an idea that would eventually reshape and transcend the confines of an entire industry, and it began with a simple question: What if our most intimate items were made as beautiful as the ones we displayed with the most pride?\n\nNow in our second decade of producing the most refined, most luxurious and most iconic objects of desire in the world, LELO has established a heritage based on quality, on unexpected innovation and on being entirely different from everything and everyone else.\n\nWe are a brand of many subtle shades, and what we actually do goes far beyond what we physically create. LELO is driven by an insatiable curiosity, a desire to explore and refine the space where digital technology and human sensation intersect. That\u2019s what makes us unique, different, and uniquely different.\n\nOur uniqueness is rooted in our design-led approach to our products. We have an intrinsic and instantly recognizable design DNA; principles which inform all of our creations from start to finish and which evolve over time to stay ahead of the tide. This means that we, like no other brand, can offer our customers new sensations before they even know they want them. How do we do that? By always looking beyond ourselves, beyond our products and beyond our industry.\n\nWhat we do is look for unexplored spaces and chances to improve on the current landscape of sensuality. It\u2019s exciting when we find such an opportunity and know we can address it, and we believe that sense of curiosity and excitement translates seamlessly into our finished products.\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way from that Stockholm townhouse. Today, we have offices across the world, from Shanghai to San Jose, but our heart and soul are still firmly in Sweden. And everything that we\u2019ve accomplished so far is due to the innovation of our award-winning products.", "employment_types": ["Full Time", "Part Time"], "selling_points":
