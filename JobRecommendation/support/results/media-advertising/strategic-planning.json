The Group has subsidiaries across Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.

Our team brings rich experiences from the buy-side, sell-side, financial media, instructional sales, auditing, public relations and other relevant industries to support a clientele of 300 listed companies across the region. For three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015, the Asia Pacific Corporate Governance Forum named Financial PR as the best financial and public relations group in the Asia Pacific region. From 2015 to 2017, Financial PR has won the\u00a0\u201cBest Investor Relations Campaign for Listed Companies\u201d\u00a0award by Marketing Magazine headquartered in London.\n\nIn August 2011, Financial PR Group entered Mainland China to establish Shanghai Shihua Financial Information Service Co., Ltd (Shanghai Shihua), becoming a subsidiary of BlueFocus Communications (300058.SZ), and the financial public relations arm of BlueFocus, the largest marketing communications group in the Asia Pacific region. Financial PR Group brought along higher value-added services such as M&A investor and media consulting & management, crisis management, investor activist management and performance IR for A share companies.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, Shanghai Shihua listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations Co (NEEQC) under the stock code of 837778, becoming the first of its kind listed on a Mainland stock exchange. Based on the last trading record, Shihua\u2019s market value is around RMB 1.07 billion. In December 2017, Shihua completed a reverse M&A to acquired Financial PR group\u2019s Singapore and Hong Kong subsidiaries.
