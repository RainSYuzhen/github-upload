When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us.\n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We\u2019re a technology driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world, so come and join us for the ride.\n\n\nWhat you\u2019ll be doing...\n\nOur Account Management team own and manage our restaurant relationships.\u00a0 As Deliveroo continues to scale, we become a major revenue channel for restaurants - aside from providing best-in-class support, we are restaurant consultants that use data-driven insight and industry knowledge to help our partner restaurants\u2019 grow.\u00a0 The AMs are a passionate, dynamic group of team players that work well together and cross functionally with other departments...and of course, they\u2019re fun, personable, and great at building relationships!\n\nYou will...\n\nManage a portfolio of key restaurants with a focus on building lasting relationships and increasing profitability / revenue\nAnalyse data on different markets and drive initiatives to increase revenues for your portfolio\nWork with cross functional departments to drive business growth (Marketing, Operations, Customer Service, Corporate)\n\nSkills you'll need...\n\nAn interest in food is great here, it's a place to unleash the foodie in you\nExcellent attention to detail, people skills and organisation skills\nAbility to create and maintain relationships\nDemonstrate experience using Microsoft Office tools and related project management applications to drive best practice\nA self-starter as we'll look for you to manage your own time and priorities\nAccount management experience (or relevant sales, BDM, community management) will be advantage, but is not required\nMust be fluent in both English and Cantonese\u00a0\n\nBenefits:\n\nBecome one of the key employees of a fast-growing, exciting startup changing the food delivery landscape\nOpen, respectful and fun company culture\nSnacks and drinks provided (although not unlimited, you will never go thirsty or hungry)\nFriday lunches on us from the best local restaurants\u00a0\nAdditional leave days for years of service\u00a0\nMeal allowance if you are required to work late\nFree Deliveroo Plus - Free delivery and access to special offers\n\nLife at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we\u2019re always looking for new ideas and we\u2019re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven\u2019t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company\u2019s success.\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.
