From 2015 to 2017, Financial PR has won the\u00a0\u201cBest Investor Relations Campaign for Listed Companies\u201d\u00a0award by Marketing Magazine headquartered in London.\n\nIn August 2011, Financial PR Group entered Mainland China to establish Shanghai Shihua Financial Information Service Co., Ltd (Shanghai Shihua), becoming a subsidiary of BlueFocus Communications (300058.SZ), and the financial public relations arm of BlueFocus, the largest marketing communications group in the Asia Pacific region.

Based on the last trading record, Shihua\u2019s market value is around RMB 1.07 billion. In December 2017, Shihua completed a reverse M&A to acquired Financial PR group\u2019s Singapore and Hong Kong subsidiaries.
