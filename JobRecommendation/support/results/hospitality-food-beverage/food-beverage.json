When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us.\n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We\u2019re a technology driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world, so come and join us for the ride.\n\nWhat the team does?\n\nOur Account Management team owns and manages our restaurant relationships.\u00a0 As Deliveroo continues to scale, we become a major revenue channel for restaurants - aside from providing best-in-class support, we are restaurant consultants that use data-driven insight and industry knowledge to help our partner restaurants\u2019 grow.\u00a0 Our account managers are a passionate, dynamic group of team players that work well together and cross functionally with other departments...and of course, they\u2019re fun, personable, and great at building relationships!\n\nWhat you'll be doing?\n\nDrive sales performance - own your portfolio partner\u2019s platform business growth through proactive reporting, analysis, improvement projects, and identifying growth opportunities. You will work with both internal and external stakeholders to drive change and devise solutions to ensure issues are addressed and the accounts continue to grow.\nMarketing - manage marketing and promotions planning for our restaurant partners as they join and scale on the platform. Keep on top of timelines and collaborate cross-functionally with our AM and Core Marketing teams to hit targets as we scale.\nConsumer value proposition - build the processes that allow our grocery partners to succeed on the platform by developing an attractive value proposition for customers, including selection, promotions, pricing and service levels.\nStakeholder management - manage a portfolio of Deliveroo's most strategically important restaurant partners, including high sales volume drivers and global brands, and ensure that our internal stakeholders are supporting where appropriate.\n\nRequirements\n\nBackground: 5 years\u2019 experience in an account management or commercial role.\nAnalytical - able to cut through the noise, get deep into data and understand the data points that drive performance improvements for our grocery partners.\nPartner-Focused - be obsessed with our restaurant partners. Use quantitative and qualitative data to build a service that is best for our customers.\nEntrepreneurial - have ideas and strategies to drive growth of our joint business with our partners, with a willingness to trial at pace.\nAdaptable Fixer - enthusiastic, flexible and adaptable with the ability to remove barriers and bottlenecks via facilitation, creativity and resourcefulness.\u00a0 Know when you have enough insight to make-a-call and apply the 80 / 20 rule.\nCross-Functional Team Player - a collaborative team player who is able to get the best out of the people around you. Able to work effectively at all levels of Deliveroo and deliver success with and through others.\nUpbeat, Confident and High Energy - bring freshness, energy and passion into the team.\u00a0 Help create a working environment that is unique, spawns new ideas and is enjoyable for the other people involve\n\nBenefits:\n\nBecome one of the key employees of a fast-growing, exciting startup changing the food delivery landscape\nOpen, respectful and fun company culture\nSnacks and drinks provided (although not unlimited, you will never go thirsty or hungry)\nWork with people who LOVE what they do\nMeal allowance if you are required to work late\nFree Deliveroo Plus - Free delivery and access to special offers\n\nLife at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we\u2019re always looking for new ideas and we\u2019re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven\u2019t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company\u2019s success.\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up\u2019s around.", "employment_types": ["Full Time"], "selling_points": [], "locations": ["Causeway Bay"], "categories": ["Hospitality / F & B", "Food & Beverage", "Others"], "post_time": "2022-01-17T07:25:51Z", "salary": {"currency": null, "max": null, "min": null, "period": "monthly", "term": null}, "salary_visible": false, "title_keywords": [], "responsibilities": [], "requirements": {"degrees": [], "majors": [], "languages": [], "language_level": [], "hard_skills": ["go"], "soft_skills": [], "languages_combined": []}, "experience_required": {"duration": [], "field": []}}, {"job_id": "100003009052409", "location_code": "hk", "company": "Wooloomooloo Group Limited", "job_title": "Bar Captain / Captain \u9152\u5427\u90e8\u9577 / \u90e8\u9577", "description": "\u8077\u8cac :\n\n\u8ca0\u8cac\u6d17\u7897\u3001\u4e00\u822c\u5eda\u623f\u6e05\u6f54\u5de5\u4f5c, \u5305\u62ec\u5012\u5783\u573e\n\u8cc7\u6b77 :\n\n\u6c92\u6709\u5b78\u6b77\u8981\u6c42;

is the 1st cocktail lounge in Lan Kwai Fong that comfortably matches mutually interested ladies and gents on site so you can stop looking and start playing with new friends on other tables. Of course, we can\u2019t guarantee that they\u2019ll say Yes :)\u00a0\n\nSome say we have brought the popular \ud5cc\ud305\ubc14 (hunting bar) culture from Gangnam to Lan Kwai Fong. Yes or no - we have optimized the matching experience in an elegant way without taking away the fun. Name us a matching bar instead.\n\nBring your partner in crime here. If not, find one here.\n\n\n\n\nHow you can make a difference\n\nCocktails are our soul. Long drinks, short drinks, shooters, or your own signature creations, we count on your mixology skills to keep our guests hydrated and entertained.\u00a0\n\nNot every guest would be super tasteful in drinks, but all of them must be tasteful in how the drinks are IG-able. Be our brand ambassador, dress pro, talk smart, mix memorable cocktails and be the bartender to be remembered.\u00a0\n\nOur maximum capacity is no more than 30 guests. As cozy as it seems, we count on you to be a team player and take care of the needs of every area and don\u2019t cage yourself in the bar area.\u00a0\n\nHere is the behind-the-scenes part. Inventory control, stock replenishment, equipment check-up, hygiene of the bar area and the entire bar. We know these ground works might not be our happiest moment, but we all know how important it is.\n\nLastly, we hope you to be more than a Bartender or a Mixologist. Depending on your calibre, we hope to involve you in business planning, sales & marketing and different commercial aspects of our business. After all, you can\u2019t be a bartender for life, right?\n\n\n\n\nHow you can stand out from the crowd\n\nExperience as a liquor license person-in-charge with a clean record will be a distinct advantage.\u00a0\n3 years or above experience working independently as a bartender. If you do not have that years of experience but trust yourself having the capability, show us what you have got.\u00a0\nExpertise in shisha mixology will be offered a more lucrative package.\u00a0\nTertiary education qualification in hospitality would be nice.\u00a0\nMost importantly, be a people-oriented person.\u00a0\n\nWhy join us?\n\nBasic salary, sales incentive, staff discount, blah blah blah, those are pretty standard that no one wants to talk about.\u00a0\n\nHow about the experience of being a pioneer in driving the matching bar culture in Lan Kwai Fong?\u00a0", "employment_types": ["Part Time"], "selling_points": [], "locations": ["Kwun Tong"], "categories": ["Hospitality / F & B", "Food & Beverage", "Others"], "post_time": "2022-01-17T07:42:46Z", "salary": {"currency": null, "max": null, "min": null, "period": "hourly", "term": null}, "salary_visible": false, "title_keywords": [], "responsibilities": ["stock replenishment", "inventory control", "hygiene", "planning"], "requirements": {"degrees": [], "majors": [], "languages": [], "language_level": [], "hard_skills": ["hope", "clean", "no", "basic", "fun", "nice", "make"], "soft_skills": ["team player", "independently", "people-oriented"], "languages_combined": []}, "experience_required": {"duration": ["3 years"], "field": []}}, {"job_id": "100003009054091", "location_code": "hk", "company": "Taste of Asia Group Limited", "job_title": "\u54c1\u724c\u5eda\u5e2b", "description": "Responsibilities:\n\nReport directly to the Group Director of Food & Beverage, oversee the central kitchen operations which includes all section operations.\nManage and implement the food safety management system (ISO22000), including update the operating specifications and standards of the factory.\nHandle complaints of food safety and quality and provide improvement plans.\nAssure product quality, maintain standards and meeting or exceeding financial goals in terms of driving profit and managing cost.\n\nRequirements:\n\nHigher Diploma or above in Food Sciences/ Food Production/ Food Manufacturing;\nFood handling experience in both raw meats and processed meats is preferable;\nMinimum 8 years of solid experience in food manufacturing and F&B, preferably knowledgeable in HACCP, GMP and ISO 22000;\nGood command of English, Cantonese and Mandarin both oral and written;\nProficiency in MS Office applications.\n\nFor application, please send your full resume to Group Director of Human Resources by clicking\u00a0[via APPLY NOW]\u00a0\u00a0or via email, Whatsapp (852) 2280 2974 or\u00a0fax (852) 2280 2757.\n\nPersonal Data Privacy\n\nWe are committed to protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of the personal data that we hold by complying with the requirements of Personal Data Privacy Ordinance with respect to the management of personal data.
