Of course, we can\u2019t guarantee that they\u2019ll say Yes :)\u00a0\n\nSome say we have brought the popular \ud5cc\ud305\ubc14 (hunting bar) culture from Gangnam to Lan Kwai Fong. Yes or no - we have optimized the matching experience in an elegant way without taking away the fun. Name us a matching bar instead.\n\nBring your partner in crime here. If not, find one here.\n\n\n\n\nHow you can make a difference\n\nCocktails are our soul. Long drinks, short drinks, shooters, or your own signature creations, we count on your mixology skills to keep our guests hydrated and entertained.\u00a0\n\nNot every guest would be super tasteful in drinks, but all of them must be tasteful in how the drinks are IG-able. Be our brand ambassador, dress pro, talk smart, mix memorable cocktails and be the bartender to be remembered.\u00a0\n\nOur maximum capacity is no more than 30 guests. As cozy as it seems, we count on you to be a team player and take care of the needs of every area and don\u2019t cage yourself in the bar area.\u00a0\n\nHere is the behind-the-scenes part. Inventory control, stock replenishment, equipment check-up, hygiene of the bar area and the entire bar. We know these ground works might not be our happiest moment, but we all know how important it is.\n\nLastly, we hope you to be more than a Bartender or a Mixologist. Depending on your calibre, we hope to involve you in business planning, sales & marketing and different commercial aspects of our business. After all, you can\u2019t be a bartender for life, right?\n\n\n\n\nHow you can stand out from the crowd\n\nExperience as a liquor license person-in-charge with a clean record will be a distinct advantage.\u00a0\n3 years or above experience working independently as a bartender. If you do not have that years of experience but trust yourself having the capability, show us what you have got.\u00a0\nExpertise in shisha mixology will be offered a more lucrative package.\u00a0\nTertiary education qualification in hospitality would be nice.\u00a0\nMost importantly, be a people-oriented person.\u00a0\n\nWhy join us?\n\nBasic salary, sales incentive, staff discount, blah blah blah, those are pretty standard that no one wants to talk about.\u00a0\n\nHow about the experience of being a pioneer in driving the matching bar culture in Lan Kwai Fong?\u00a0",
